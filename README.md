# Bank_Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps financial analysts and decision-makers monitor and compare daily portfolio values across different customer categories (corporate and retail). It visualizes key metrics such as yesterday’s portfolio amount, previous day’s amount, change amount, and reserve amount. The dashboard breaks down the data by categories (CAT3 and CAT2), showing detailed changes in sub-categories like auto loans, credit cards, and corporate accounts. With intuitive charts and tables, it facilitates quick analysis of financial trends, portfolio growth or decline, and aids in strategic planning based on customer segments.

A navigating menu is available on the left side, allowing users to navigate between different views such as Overview, Yesterday, Previous, and Change amount. This enhances interactivity and enables targeted analysis based on specific time frames or performance metrics.

An advanced filtering menu is included on the right side, allowing users to dynamically slice the data based on multiple dimensions such as Segment, Category, Sub-category, Status, Standard/Non-standard classification, and BUCKET (e.g., aging buckets). This enhances interactivity and enables users to perform focused analysis on specific data subsets for better insights and decision-making.


## Data Preparation Summary

In this dashboard, the raw data has been loaded from Database.xlsx file then cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. Calculated columns and DAX measures were created to compute key metrics such as change amount, change percentage, and category-wise totals. Additional data transformation steps, including data type conversions, missing value handling, and hierarchy creation (e.g., CAT3 → CAT2), were also performed to enable meaningful analysis and visualization.
